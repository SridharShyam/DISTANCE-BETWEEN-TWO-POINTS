## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance between two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Get the four coordinate values from the user
### Step 2: 
Use import.math to assign the distance formula
### Step 3:
Substitute the values in the distance formula ![WhatsApp Image 2023-12-25 at 13 07 18_d2b6c2e6](https://github.com/SridharShyam/DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS/assets/144871368/f977e454-081c-4dec-9f1e-93f18a029ac5)

### Step 4: 
Round the value up to two decimal values and the print values it would be calculated
### Step 5: 
End the program
### PROGRAM:
```

import math
x1=10
y1=6
x2=4
y2=2
d=math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)
r=round(d,2)
print(r)
```

### RESULT:
Thus finding the distance between two points are successfully executed
